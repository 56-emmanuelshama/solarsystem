        <h1> <i>The Solar System</i></h1>
        <P>The Solar System is our cosmic neighborhood, a fascinating collection of planets, moons, <br>
            and other celestial objects orbiting around the Sunâ€”a star at the center of it all. <br>
             Formed over 4.6 billion years ago from a cloud of gas and dust, the Solar System includes eight major planets, <br>
              many dwarf planets, and countless asteroids, comets, and moons.</P>

            <h1> The Sun</h1>
            <p>At the heart of the Solar System is the Sun, <br>
                 a giant ball of hot gases that provides light and heat, <br>
                  making life on Earth possible. It contains 99.86% of the <br>
                   Solar System's mass and holds everything in orbit through its gravity.</p>

            <p>The eight planets are divided into two groups:

                    <li>Inner Rocky Planets:
                        <ol>
                            <li>Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars</li>
                            <li>Small, solid, and close to the Sun</li>

        <h1>Earth - Our Home</h1>
        <p>Earth is the only planet known to support life, <br>
             thanks to its liquid water, protective atmosphere, <br>
              and comfortable temperature. Scientists are constantly <br>
               studying other planets and moons to see if life might exist elsewhere.</p>

                <li>Asteroid Belt between Mars and Jupiter</li>

            <p>Humans have sent dozens of spacecraft to explore the Solar System. <br>
                 Rovers like Curiosity roam Mars, and probes like Voyager have traveled <br>
                  beyond the planets, sending back valuable information about our universe.</p>
