      <h2>What is Jupiter?</h2>
      <p>
        Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in our solar system. It is a gas giant, more than 11 times the diameter of Earth and over 300 times more massive. Despite its size, it has a very short day, completing one rotation in just under 10 hours.
      </p>
      <p>
        Named after the Roman king of the gods, Jupiter is a dominant force in the solar system. Its strong gravity influences other planets and even protects Earth by attracting or deflecting comets and asteroids.
      </p>

    <section id="structure">
      <h2>Structure & Composition</h2>
      <p>
        Jupiter is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium, similar to a star. It lacks a solid surface; instead, it has dense clouds and gas layers surrounding a possible rocky or metallic core.
      </p>
      <p>
        Its atmosphere is divided into colorful bands of clouds that move in alternating directions. These zones and belts are caused by powerful jet streams and extreme atmospheric pressure. Lightning, storms, and auroras are common phenomena in Jupiter's atmosphere.
      </p>

    <section id="storm">
      <h2>The Great Red Spot</h2>
      <p>
        One of Jupiter’s most iconic features is the Great Red Spot—a massive, swirling storm larger than Earth. It has been raging for at least 350 years and possibly much longer.
      </p>
      <p>
        The storm rotates counterclockwise and is fueled by Jupiter’s fast rotation and turbulent atmosphere. Its reddish color is still a mystery, but it may be caused by chemical reactions high in the planet's atmosphere.

    <section id="moons">
      <h2>Moons of Jupiter</h2>
      <p>
        Jupiter has at least 95 confirmed moons, making it one of the most moon-rich planets in the solar system. The four largest moons, called the Galilean moons, are:
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Io:</strong> The most volcanically active body in the solar system.</li>
          <li><strong>Europa:</strong> Covered in ice and believed to have a subsurface ocean that may support life.</li>
          <li><strong>Ganymede:</strong> The largest moon in the solar system, even bigger than Mercury.</li>
          <li><strong>Callisto:</strong> Heavily cratered and ancient, possibly with a buried ocean.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

    <section id="facts">
      <h2>Fun Facts</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Jupiter has the shortest day of all the planets—just under 10 hours.</li>
        <li>Its magnetic field is 14 times stronger than Earth’s.</li>
        <li>A spacecraft would be crushed by the pressure long before reaching the core.</li>
        <li>Jupiter radiates more heat than it receives from the Sun.</li>
        <li>Its rings are faint and made of dust, unlike Saturn's icy rings.</li>
      </ul>
