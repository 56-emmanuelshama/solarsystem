      <h2>What is Mercury?</h2>
      <p>Mercury is the first planet from the Sun and the smallest in the solar system. Despite being closest to the Sun, it’s not the hottest planet—that title goes to Venus. Mercury has a rocky surface and is one of the four terrestrial planets.</p>

    <section id="surface">
      <h2>Surface & Climate</h2>
      <p>The surface of Mercury is heavily cratered and resembles Earth's Moon. The planet has no atmosphere to trap heat, so temperatures swing from -180°C at night to 430°C during the day.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="mythology">
      <h2>History & Mythology</h2>
      <p>In Roman mythology, Mercury was the swift messenger god, known for his speed. The Greeks called him Hermes. The planet was named Mercury because of how fast it moves across the sky.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="missions">
      <h2>Space Missions</h2>
      <p>Several missions have explored Mercury. The most notable are Mariner 10 and MESSENGER, which orbited and photographed the planet. These missions helped scientists understand its composition, orbit, and magnetic field.</p>
