      <h2>What is Venus?</h2>
      <p>
        Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is often called Earth’s twin because of its similar size and composition. However, the two planets are drastically different in their environments. Venus is named after the Roman goddess of love and beauty, and it's the brightest natural object in the night sky after the Moon.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unlike Earth, Venus has a thick, toxic atmosphere and an extremely hot surface. It's covered with mountains, volcanoes, and vast plains of solidified lava, indicating a geologically active past.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="atmosphere">
      <h2>Atmosphere & Surface</h2>
      <p>
        The atmosphere of Venus is made mostly of carbon dioxide (about 96.5%) and thick clouds of sulfuric acid, making it extremely reflective and bright. The pressure on Venus is 92 times greater than Earth's—equivalent to being 900 meters underwater.
      </p>
      <p>
        The surface temperature averages around 467°C (872°F), hotter than Mercury—even though Venus is farther from the Sun. This is due to the runaway greenhouse effect, where heat is trapped by the thick atmosphere.
      </p>
      <p>
        Venus has plains formed by lava flows, mountainous regions, and many large shield volcanoes. Its surface has been mapped in detail using radar from spacecraft like NASA's Magellan.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="climate">
      <h2>Climate & Weather</h2>
      <p>
        Venus has the harshest climate in the solar system. Its sky is covered in thick clouds that swirl around the planet quickly, producing constant lightning and acidic rain. However, the rain evaporates before reaching the surface due to the intense heat.
      </p>
      <p>
        Winds at the cloud tops can reach up to 360 km/h (224 mph), much faster than the planet's own rotation. These super-rotating winds create extreme and stable global conditions, unlike the dynamic weather systems found on Earth.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section id="orbit">
      <h2>Rotation & Orbit</h2>
      <p>
        Venus has an unusual rotation. It spins very slowly and in the opposite direction of most planets (retrograde rotation). A day on Venus (one full rotation) takes about 243 Earth days, which is longer than its year—225 Earth days.
      </p>
      <p>
        This slow and backward rotation means the Sun rises in the west and sets in the east on Venus. Despite its slow rotation, its atmosphere circulates rapidly, completing a loop around the planet in just 4 Earth days.
